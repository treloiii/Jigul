<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is my small framework for Java, which includes IoC and Web.<br>
IoC part contains: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Auto generated objects
    </li>
    <li>
        Dependency injection by init fields in object
    </li>
</ul>
Web part contains:
<ul>
    <li>
        very small embedded self-written HTTP server
    </li>
    <li>
        pattern for create RESTful applications like in Spring web
    </li>
</ul>
There is small functionality in each part, but its cool study project.<br>

<h2>Docs and examples of use</h2>
<h3>Generics</h3>
First of all to make framework work you need to create configuration class, which will be configure your project.<br>
To make a configuration class you need to create empty class and mark it annotation

    @Config(String[] iocPackage,String[] webPackage)
First parameter is String array of packages name which you want to include in IoC<br>
Second parameter is String array of packages name which you want to include in Web<br>

<h5>Example</h5>
    
    @Config(iocPackage={"com.example","com.example.test"},webPackage={"com.example.web"})
    public class Configuration{
    }

<h3>IoC</h3>


To automatically instantiate object you need to use annotation:
    
    @AutoGenerated(String instanceType)
param instanceType can be init by call static fields of class InstanceType
    
    InstanceType.SINGLE="Single"
    InstanceType.MULTI="Multi"
Another String values of instanceType param are incorrect<br>
By default:

    instanceType=InstanceType.MULTI
AutoGenerated annotation can be used only on Types (classes)<br>

>InstanceType.SINGLE note that object will be created once, and new call to @AutoGenerated type will return you that one object

>InstanceType.MULTI note that call to @AutoGenerated type will create you a new instance of object

<h5>Example</h5>
    
    @AutoGenerated(instanceType=InstanceType.MULTI)
    public class Cat{
        ...
    }
All objects which marked @AutoGenerated will be instantiated and placed into pool, where can they be obtained from.<br>
>**Note: class which marked @AutoGenerated must have a default constructor**<br>

To get your marked object you need to initialize object of type ObjectPool and get Configuration object which use in ObjectPool constructor, and use it.<br>
To get Configuration object just use it static method:

    Configuration.getConfiguration();
Getting object from ObjectPool:
<h5>Example</h5>
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ...
        ObjectPool pool=new ObjectPool(configuration);
        Cat cat=pool.getPooledObject(Cat.class);
        cat.meow();
    }
<h4>Dependency Injection</h4>
If you want to make your code less dependent you can inject class fields by annotation

    @Injectable
Type of field that marked by this annotation need to be marked by @AutoGenerated<br>
Field that marked @Injectable will be automatically initialized<br>
<h5>Example</h5>
    
    @AutoGenerated
    public class Car{
        private String mark;
        @Injectable
        private Cat passanger;
        Car(){}
        ...
    }
>**Note: if you try to instantiate object with @Injectable fields by operator new, you will get the InstantiatingException**<br>
To avoid this exception get your object from ObjectPool<br>

<h5>Example</h5>
    
    ...
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Car car=new Car();//Error!
        ...
        ObjectPool pool=new ObjectPool(configuration);
        Car car1=pool.getPooledObject(Car.class);//All right!
    }
